## Project Overview

Jhae Blog is a solo project by **Ajaero Stanley Chibundu** that aims to create a comprehensive blogging platform built with a modern tech stack. The blog provides dynamic content creation, authentication, and user interaction through comments and likes, along with visual data analytics to track user engagement.

### Key Objectives:
- Build a fast and responsive blogging platform with modern technologies.
- Enable features such as authentication, file uploads, user profiles, and post analytics.
- Utilize serverless architecture for scalability and performance.

## Features

- **User Authentication:** Secure login and signup functionality using Auth.js.
- **Dynamic User Profiles:** Each user has a unique, dynamically generated profile page (e.g., `/profile/[username]`).
- **Post Creation:** Users can create, edit, and publish blog posts with tags and categories.
- **Comments & Likes:** Users can interact with posts by commenting and liking.
- **File Uploads:** Uploadcare is integrated for secure and efficient media uploads.
- **Analytics:** Recharts is used to visualize post metrics like views and interactions.
- **Responsive Design:** Tailwind CSS ensures the blog is mobile-friendly and responsive across devices.

## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **Next.js**: A React framework for building server-rendered applications.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for creating responsive designs quickly.

### Backend
- **NeonDB**: Serverless Postgres database used for storing user, post, and comment data.
- **Recharts**: A charting library for visualizing user interaction data.
- **Auth.js**: Provides secure user authentication, including login and sign-up functionality.

### File Uploads
- **Uploadcare**: A cloud-based file upload service for handling image and media uploads.

### Hosting
- **Vercel**: Used for hosting and deploying the project with automatic scaling and CDN support.

## Architecture

- **Frontend**: Built with Next.js for server-side rendering and client-side functionality. It handles user input, state management, and communication with backend services.
  
- **Backend**: Utilizes NeonDB for all database-related operations. The backend handles CRUD operations for blog posts, users, and comments.

- **Authentication**: Managed using Auth.js, providing a secure method for users to register and authenticate.

- **File Uploads**: Uploadcare is integrated for handling media uploads such as images attached to blog posts.

- **Hosting**: The entire app is deployed on Vercel, leveraging serverless technology to ensure smooth scaling.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:
- **Node.js** (v16 or higher)
- **npm** or **yarn**
- A **NeonDB** account and **Uploadcare** account

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/jhaeblog.git
cd jhaeblog
```

### Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add the following:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_UPLOADCARE_PUBLIC_KEY=<Your Uploadcare Public Key>
NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH_API_URL=<Your Auth.js API URL>
NEXT_PUBLIC_DATABASE_URL=<Your NeonDB URL>
NEXT_PUBLIC_VERCEL_URL=<Your Vercel URL>
```

### Running the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Your app will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Building for Production

To create a production-ready build:

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```

This will create an optimized version of the app.

### Deploying to Vercel

If you are deploying to Vercel, connect the repository and push the code. Vercel will handle the deployment and automatic scaling.

## Usage

1. **Sign Up / Log In**: Users can register and log in through the Auth.js integration.
2. **Create Blog Posts**: Once logged in, users can create blog posts, tag them, and upload media files using Uploadcare.
3. **Interact with Posts**: Comment and like posts created by other users.
4. **View User Profiles**: Visit dynamic profile pages based on usernames (e.g., `/profile/stanity`).
5. **View Analytics**: Users can see data visualizations of their post views and interactions via Recharts.

## Challenges and Solutions

- **Learning Curve**: Adapting to new technologies like NeonDB and Uploadcare presented challenges, but online resources and documentation helped overcome them.
- **Time Management**: Implementing a full-stack blog in a short timeframe required focusing on key features and avoiding scope creep.
- **Third-Party Integration**: Ensuring seamless integration between multiple third-party services like Auth.js and Uploadcare required careful testing and debugging.

### Solutions:
- Using existing frameworks (Next.js, Tailwind) sped up development.
- Breaking down the project into smaller, manageable tasks helped stay on track.
- Leveraging community resources when facing issues with new technologies.

## Areas for Improvement

- **Performance**: Optimize file uploads and caching to improve load times.
- **Security**: Further strengthen authentication and secure API routes.
- **UI Enhancements**: Additional focus on improving the user interface for a more polished experience.

## Future Plans

- **Social Sharing**: Add the ability to share posts on social media platforms.
- **Dark Mode**: Introduce a dark mode for improved accessibility and user customization.
- **Advanced Analytics**: Extend the analytics section with more detailed insights into user engagement.
